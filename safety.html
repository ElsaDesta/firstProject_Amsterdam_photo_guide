          <em>Emergency number 112</em> If you moved to the Netherlands from a
          European country, it’s likely nothing will change for you. The main
          emergency number for most European countries is 112.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Dutch Police</em>If you have an emergency that requires the
          police, you should call the emergency number 112. If you don’t have an
          emergency, but you still need to contact the police, you can call:
          0900-8844. In the Netherlands, it’s also possible to report certain
          crimes online.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Medical Emergencies</em>You can call the Central Doctors’ Service
          on +31 (0) 20 592 34 34 if you do not need an ambulance, but are in

        The Netherlands is known for its tolerant policies on drugs. Many people
        don’t realise that drugs are officially illegal in the Netherlands.
        Understanding Dutch drug policy can save you a lot of problems. If you
        still buy drugs in the Netherlands, you should be keenly aware that the
        potency of the drugs can differ a great deal from the strength of drugs
        in your own country. In other words, you never know how strong your
        purchased drugs will be. If you are trying drugs for the first time or
        don’t have much experience, be extra careful. We advise you to take a
        lower dose than you would take in your home country. If you are staying
        in Amsterdam for more than a week, you can get your drugs tested
        anonymously at couple of Amsterdam drug testing services. Drugs you
        submit to them are analysed in a laboratory.

        Biking in Amsterdam is a quintessentially Dutch experience, and it's by
        far the most popular and most efficient way of getting around. But
        Amsterdam's frenzied flow of traffic and confusing streets can
        intimidate visitors on two wheels. Read these tips for keeping yourself
        and your bike safe before you hop on your cruiser. Amsterdam's 400 km
        (249 miles) of bike lanes and paths (​fietspaden) make city cycling
        safe. They usually run along the right sides of streets. Some two-way
        lanes are on one side only. They typically feature white lines and bike
        symbols painted on the road or on the reddish-colored path. Always give
        right of way to trams from any direction. Listen for the distinctive
        clanging of their bells. As for all other vehicles and bikes, give right
        of way to traffic approaching from the right. Traffic coming from your
        left should give you the right of way. Taxis and buses often push the
        limits on this rule, so err on the side of caution when they approach.
